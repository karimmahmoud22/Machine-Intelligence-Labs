# Machine Intelligence Labs using Python

## Overview
Welcome to the Machine Intelligence Labs repository! This repository contains Python implementations of various problem sets focusing on different aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Each problem set is designed to provide hands-on experience with solving real-world problems using Python and machine intelligence techniques.

## Problem Sets

### Problem Set(0): Introduction to Python
This problem set introduces fundamental concepts of Python programming language. Topics covered include basic data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming principles. Participants will gain a solid understanding of Python syntax and its applications in solving simple problems.

### Problem Set(1): Search
In this problem set, participants will explore various search algorithms such as breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), and A* search. They will apply these algorithms to solve problems in pathfinding, puzzle-solving, and optimization.

### Problem Set(2): CSP & Games
This problem set focuses on Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) and game playing strategies. Participants will learn about representing and solving CSPs using backtracking, forward checking, and constraint propagation techniques. They will also implement game playing agents using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for adversarial games.

### Problem Set(3): Reinforcement Learning
In this problem set, participants will delve into the field of reinforcement learning. They will implement various reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN). Participants will apply these algorithms to solve problems in gridworld navigation, control tasks, and game playing.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the problem sets.
3. Open each problem set folder and follow the instructions provided in the README or Jupyter notebooks.
4. Use a Python interpreter or a Jupyter notebook environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab) to execute the scripts or notebooks.
5. Experiment with different parameters, datasets, and scenarios to gain a deeper understanding of machine intelligence techniques.
